# Snap Describe Frontend

Welcome to the frontend of your Expo app! 🚀  
This project was bootstrapped with [Expo](https://expo.dev) using [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

### 2. Start the App

```bash
yarn start
```

### 3. Run on iOS Simulator

To open the app directly in the iOS simulator (macOS only):

```bash
npm run ios
```

> **Note:**
>
> - You must have Xcode installed.
> - The simulator will launch automatically if it’s not already running.

This will launch the Expo development server. In the terminal or browser, you’ll see options to open the app in:

- [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) (for quick testing on your device)

## 🗂️ Project Structure

- `app/` — Main application code (uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction))
- `components/` — Reusable UI components
- `constants/` — Shared constants (e.g., colors)
- `hooks/` — Custom React hooks
- `assets/` — Images, fonts, and other static assets
- `scripts/` — Utility scripts

---

## 🧹 Resetting the Project

To reset the project to a blank state:

```bash
yarn reset-project
```

This will move the starter code to the `app-example` directory and create a fresh `app/` directory for development.
